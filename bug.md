- Ok for now I have a problem with the Notification System. Something I have done to add this feature in my application

* Add the permission to AndroidManifest: POST_NOTIFICATIONS, SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM
* In notification_vm, just ignore the comment said 20:00 and the real code is something different because i was testing it
* and i want to use time in SaiGon/VietNam

-> So can you help me fix the Notification please? For now, everything fine but when I enable it,I don't see any notification
